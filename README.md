Inconsistent linear programs (LPs) currently provide a dead-end in optimisation
problems, forcing manual intervention. Many real-life industrial problems can
be expressed as LPs (sometimes with large numbers of decision variables and
constraints). It is usually assumed that there is at least one feasible solution,
but sometimes due to manual error in formulating the problem or a misunderstanding of the solution space, there might not be a feasible solution. In which
case, a way to automatically pinpoint these errors (e.g. finding some minimal
set of infeasible constraints) so the industrial partner can correct them, or have
an augmented LP returned to them, needs to be formulated. This project will
discuss how to pinpoint these errors and augment LPs that have no feasible
solutions.
